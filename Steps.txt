1. First apply the high pass filter on the 3-axis acceleration signal.
2. Then convert the data into 1D acceleration signal.
3. Then apply segmentation using threshold value. 
            [Currently, you are segmenting using the exactly velocity match. Try to segment using some threshold value.]
            [Define a threshold value, and do segmentation based on this thrshold rather than doing segmentation with exact match].
4. Then do rendering using inverse weighted interpolation approach if the velocity does not match with the user applied velocity.
otherwise if the user applied velocity matches with the velocity data you collected then do rendering with the acceleration signal you already save after the segmentation.
